# Homework3: 
PyParagraph challenge

#
# The resources sub-directory contains both input as well output files.
#
# In addition to the input files provided for this exercise, I also created another
#    input file called paragraph_0.txt which contains the input text in the instructions.
#    This file can be used to double check against the results in the instructions.
#
# Note: I believe the instructions contain an error; specifically, the word count
#    should be 121 (and not 122). I validated this using wc command:
#    "wc -w paragraph_0.txt" produces 121

# Homework3: 
Python challenges

#
# Each subdirectory corresponds to one challenge: PyBank, PyPoll, PyBoss and PyParagraph.
#
# Each subdirectory contains a python script called main.py that processes input
#    data in the Resources subdirectory, and produces output which is also saved
#    in an output file in the Resources subdirectory.
#
# Each script is commented to indicate how input files are processed and output files 
#    are produced.
# 
# In the case of PyPoll, input data files were truncated to conserve disk space in the
#    github repository.  This truncation was acheived by using the "head -20" command,
#    and was performed after processing the complete input files. This means the output
#    files contain the results for the full datasets provided for this assignment.

# PyPoll challenge
#
# Note the input data files in the Resources subdirectory were truncated to conserve disk 
#    space in the github repository.  This truncation was acheived by using the "head -20"
#    command, and was performed after processing the complete input files. This means the
#    output files contain the results for the full datasets provided for this assignment.
